Hi there 👋

Long story short, I'm a front-end developer specializing in React, Next.js, design, and Tailwind CSS!
My deep passion of coding led me to this world, and I started learning coding all by myself and I'm pleased to announce that I'm a proud self-taught developer, who seeks the power of knowledge wherever I can find it.
I love working in teams and finding new friends in the process. Eager to dive straight into unknown world and challenges, just to come out stronger, more seasoned and experienced.
Also, I happen to possses a great sense of humer! :)

Many people consider `CSS` difficult.

We think everyone building web apps/sites should learn `CSS`.
However we agree that it can feel frustrating and often overwhelming.
Many software engineers/developers feel they already have enough to learn with the rest of their chosen "stack", so investing the time to perfect the interface design & layout feels like too much. We get it!
